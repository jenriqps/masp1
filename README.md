The purpose of this repository is to calculate simulations, gross premiums and reserves of some types of insurance that I teach in my class in Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico (aka UNAM) (http://www.fciencias.unam.mx/licenciatura/asignaturas/2017/1408)
. If you want to know all the context, please go to https://sites.google.com/view/masp1/p%C3%A1gina-principal/notas-de-clase?authuser=0. I use SAS and XML code to implement my examples.
